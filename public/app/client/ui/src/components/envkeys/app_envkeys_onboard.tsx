        You can generate local keys <strong>manually</strong> below, but
        normally <em>you shouldn't need to.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Local keys load your app's development environment or a branch of the
        development environment. They're generated{" "}
        <strong>automatically</strong> the first time you start an
        EnvKey-enabled app--you just need to be sure you have EnvKey installed,
        you're signed in, and your app has a <strong>.envkey</strong> file in
        its root directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your app is missing a <strong>.envkey</strong> file, you can add it
        by running the <code>envkey init</code> command in your app's root
        directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local keys are tied to the <strong>device</strong> they're generated on.
        If a device is revoked, all its local keys will also be revoked.
