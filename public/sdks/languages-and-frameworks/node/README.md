# envkey npm package

Integrate [EnvKey](https://www.envkey.com) with your Node.js projects to keep api keys, credentials, and other configuration securely and automatically in sync for developers and servers.

## Installation

```bash
npm install 'envkey' --save
```

## Usage

If you haven't already, download and install EnvKey from our [website](https://envkey.com), then create a new org. Next, follow the ~1 minute [integration quickstart](https://docs-v2.envkey.com/docs/integration-quickstart) to init an app with a `.envkey` file (for connecting development) or generate a server `ENVKEY` (for connecting a server).

Then at the entry point of your application:

```javascript
// main.js
require("envkey");
```

Or if you're using TypeScript/ES6+ imports:

```javascript
// main.ts / main.js
import "envkey";
```

Now all your EnvKey variables will be available on `process.env`.

### Errors

The package will throw an error if an `ENVKEY` is missing or invalid.

### Overriding Vars

This package will not overwrite existing environment variables or additional variables set in the `.env` file you loaded your `ENVKEY` from. This can be convenient for customizing environments that otherwise share the same configuration. You can also use [branches or local overrides](https://docs-v2.envkey.com/docs/branches-and-local-overrides) for this purpose.

### Working Offline

This package caches your encrypted config in development so that you can still use it while offline. Your config will still be available (though possibly not up-to-date) the next time you lose your internet connection. If you do have a connection available, envkey will always load the latest config. Your cached encrypted config is stored in `$HOME/.envkey/cache`

For caching purposes, this package assumes you're in development mode if `process.env.NODE_ENV` is "development" or "test".

You can also turn on caching by setting a `ENVKEY_SHOULD_CACHE=1` environment variable when running your app (_not_ in your EnvKey config):

```bash
ENVKEY_SHOULD_CACHE=1 node your_app.js
```

### Custom Loading

If you want more control over how/when envkey loads your config, you can import/require the loader module directly instead of the top-level package that autoloads.

With require:

```javascript
const envkeyLoader = require("envkey/loader");

envkeyLoader.load({
  dotEnvFile: ".staging.env", // where to find the dotEnv file that contains your ENVKEY,
  permitted: ["KEY1", "KEY2"], // allow-list of permitted vars (useful for client-side config) - defaults to permitting all if omitted
});
```

Or with imports:

```javascript
import { load as envkeyLoad } from "envkey/loader";

envkeyLoad({ dotEnvFile: ".staging.env" });
```

You can also load your config asynchronously by providing a callback to the load function:

```javascript
const envkeyLoader = require("envkey/loader");

envkeyLoader.load(
  {
    dotEnvFile: ".staging.env", // where to find the dotEnv file that contains your ENVKEY,
    permitted: ["KEY1", "KEY2"], // allow-list of permitted vars (useful for client-side config) - defaults to permitting all if omitted
  },
  function (err, res) {
    console.log("Config loaded");
    console.log(process.env.KEY1);
  }
);
```

For even more flexibility, you can use the `fetch` method to return your config as simple json and do as you wish with it. As with `load`, it can be called synchronously or asynchronously.

```javascript
const envkeyLoader = require("envkey/loader");

// synchronous
const config = envkeyLoader.fetch({
  dotEnvFile: ".staging.env",
  permitted: ["KEY1", "KEY2"],
});
console.log(config.KEY1);

// asynchronous
envkeyLoader.fetch(
  {
    dotEnvFile: ".staging.env",
    permitted: ["KEY1", "KEY2"],
  },
  function (err, res) {
    console.log(res.KEY1);
  }
);
```

If you're using **TypeScript**, typings for the `load` and `fetch` functionas are included.

## Client-Side Config In The Browser

Since EnvKey is for configuration in addition to secrets, it can be convenient to inject a portion of your EnvKey config into your client-side code. This should be done by allow-listing variables that are safe for the client (i.e. can be made public) and injecting them during your build process. EnvKey has a [webpack plugin](https://github.com/envkey/envkey/public/sdks/languages-and-framworks/webpack) to help you do it right.

## envkey-source

Using a language-specific library like this one is the easiest and fastest method of integrating with EnvKey. That said, the [envkey-source](https://docs-v2.envkey.com/docs/envkey-source) executable, which this library wraps, provides additional options and functionality when used directly from the command line. If you need additional flexibility and it works for your use case, consider using envkey-source directly.

## x509 error / ca-certificates

On a stripped down OS like Alpine Linux, you may get an `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` error when attempting to load your config. You can fix it by ensuring that the `ca-certificates` dependency is installed. On Alpine you'll want to run:

```
apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
```
