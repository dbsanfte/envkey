- Process model update: fixes a number of rare race conditions due to process inconsistencies and/or high CPU usage, as well as occasional v1 > v2 upgrade issues
- Improved upgrades: upgrades now run in the background in a small footer rather than a modal window so you can still use EnvKey while upgrades are running
- Report error functionality at bottom of org settings menu
