- Fix for daemon exiting prematurely when running with --mem-cache flag
- Local .env file overrides are now applied even if the .env file doesn't contain an ENVKEY
- When looking for a .env or .envkey file, envkey-source now looks recursively upward in parent directories if one isn't found in the current directory, providing more flexibility for varying directory structures
